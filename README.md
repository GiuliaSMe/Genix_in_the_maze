# Genix_in_the_maze
                                       
My first game, made with GameMaker Engine.

Genix is a bunny who just wanna eat her carrots in peace, take good care of her!

Use the arrow keys to move Genix.
If necessary, the spacebar restarts the level.

*Game in PT-BR, if you don't speak portuguese it wont affect your gameplay, except for the tutorial storytelling that (trust me) it's not a big deal
